# Intro-To-Me

Hello! My name is Nova! 

I could also go by Poseidon, Asher, or Damien.

I have DiD (Disassociative Identity Disorder) and Asher and Damien are my alters.

I am Polyromantic, hyperromantic, asexual, and in a relationship with my ammazing girlfriend Ari and I love her dearly even though she knows I can be difficult. She understands me in ways I thought no one would.
